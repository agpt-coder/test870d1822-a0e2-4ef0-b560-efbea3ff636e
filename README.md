# test

To create an endpoint that connects to GROQ and takes in an emoji as input to explain its meaning, you'll need to complete several steps leveraging the tech stack provided: Python for programming, FastAPI as the API framework, PostgreSQL as the database, and Prisma as the ORM.

1. Setup FastAPI project and integrate Prisma with PostgreSQL for database operations.
2. Create a model in Prisma to store emoji meanings obtained from the GROQ documentation or an emoji dictionary.
3. Use the Python `requests` library to connect to the GROQ API endpoint. In the endpoint handler, accept an emoji as input.
4. Use the GROQ API to query the meaning of the provided emoji by sending a query from FastAPI to GROQ. You might need to format the query according to GROQ's syntax for retrieving the specific emoji meaning.
5. Process the response from GROQ, extracting the emoji meaning. Ensure error handling is robust to manage cases where an emoji might not be found or the GROQ service is unavailable.
6. Store or update the emoji meaning in PostgreSQL via Prisma, to cache results and reduce API calls for commonly requested emojis.
7. Return the emoji’s meaning to the user in a structured response from your FastAPI endpoint.

Important Considerations:
- Implement rate limiting and caching to optimize the performance and avoid hitting GROQ service limits.
- Ensure the emoji input from users is validated to guard against injection attacks or malformed inputs.
- Review FastAPI’s async capabilities to make non-blocking calls to the GROQ API, improving the endpoint’s responsiveness.
- Regularly update your emoji database as new emojis are added or meanings are updated.

## What you'll need to run this
* An unzipper (usually shipped with your OS)
* A text editor
* A terminal
* Docker
  > Docker is only needed to run a Postgres database. If you want to connect to your own
  > Postgres instance, you may not have to follow the steps below to the letter.


## How to run 'test'

1. Unpack the ZIP file containing this package

2. Adjust the values in `.env` as you see fit.

3. Open a terminal in the folder containing this README and run the following commands:

    1. `poetry install` - install dependencies for the app

    2. `docker-compose up -d` - start the postgres database

    3. `prisma generate` - generate the database client for the app

    4. `prisma db push` - set up the database schema, creating the necessary tables etc.

4. Run `uvicorn project.server:app --reload` to start the app

## How to deploy on your own GCP account
1. Set up a GCP account
2. Create secrets: GCP_EMAIL (service account email), GCP_CREDENTIALS (service account key), GCP_PROJECT, GCP_APPLICATION (app name)
3. Ensure service account has following permissions: 
    Cloud Build Editor
    Cloud Build Service Account
    Cloud Run Developer
    Service Account User
    Service Usage Consumer
    Storage Object Viewer
4. Remove on: workflow, uncomment on: push (lines 2-6)
5. Push to master branch to trigger workflow
